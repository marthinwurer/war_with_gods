# War With Gods

War With Gods is a thing we are building. Probably an 2D ARPG.

## Building

Run Cmake:

```
cmake -B build-folder/ .
```

*Note:* If compiling on Window, be sure to specify the CMake generator with `-G ${GENERATOR}`.

## Testing

TODO: Figure out how to pass a preprocessor define into CMake

A test build can be generated by defining the preprocessor flag `TEST_BUILD` in code and running cmake from the root of the project directory:

```
cmake -B build-folder/ .
```

Make a PR and hope we are merciful.
